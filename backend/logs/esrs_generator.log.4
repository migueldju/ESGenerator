This includes pollution of water, which is identified as a relevant environmental problem linked to road transport. Fuel and oil spills from motor vehicles can contaminate soil and water, and undertakings must disclose the estimated total number of accidents causing fuel leakage. Additionally, the use of biofuels in transport can lead to water pollution, and undertakings must disclose information on the environmental impacts of their biofuel use. The ESRS also requires undertakings to disclose information on their water management practices, including their water consumption and wastewater generation. </p>\n<p>Undertakings must explain how their corporate communication aligns with globally established targets related to climate neutrality or nature positive economy and how they ensure that their sustainability communication is clear, transparent, substantiated, and specific. If the communication relates to water and marine resources, undertakings must explain how they ensure consistency with their disclosures under ESRS E3. </p>\n<p>The proportion of communication spendings dedicated to influencing political opinion with regard to material impacts, risks, and opportunities related to water and marine resources must also be disclosed. Undertakings must provide information on the actions they take to ensure clear, transparent, and substantiated communication related to water and marine resources. </p>\n<p>The ESRS requires undertakings to disclose the number of opened cases before courts or other competent authorities within the reporting year that concern misleading commercial practices or public communication related to sustainability, including water and marine resources. The number of cases that were closed during the reporting year and the outcome of these cases must also be disclosed. </p>\n<p>Overall, the ESRS provides a comprehensive framework for undertakings to disclose their sustainability performance related to water and marine resources, and to ensure that their communication is clear, transparent, and substantiated.</p>', 'Q: water', 'A: <h3>Water</h3>\n<p>The European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) require undertakings to disclose information related to water and marine resources.
